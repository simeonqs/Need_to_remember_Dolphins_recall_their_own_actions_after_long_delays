**Abstract**


------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Some large model files are not available in this repository. They can be downloaded from Zenodo after publication. That repository also contains all code, so replicating results is easier from there.

**File information and meta data:**

- `.gitignore`: tells git which files should not be synchronised
- `LICENSE`: file with license details
- `README.md`: the file you are reading right now
- `dolphin_memory_new.Rproj`: R project file, if you open this all paths will work for this repo
- `statistical_analysis.Rmd`: R markdown document with all LaTeX code for the models
- `statistical_analysis.docx`: Word version of the models
- `statistical_analysis.pdf`: PDF version of the models

- `analysis/code/00_prospective_delay_load_data.R`: script to load the data for the trials testing prospective memory including delays
- `analysis/code/01_prospective_delay_run_model.R`: script to run the models for the trials testing prospective memory including delays
- `analysis/code/02_prospective_control_load_data.R`: script to load the data for control trials, where dolphins had not been trained to expect a delay
- `analysis/code/03_prospective_control_run_models.R`: script to run the models for control trials, where dolphins had not been trained to expect a delay
- `analysis/code/04_retrospective_no_delay_load_data.R`: script to load the data for the trials testing retrospective memory, without delays
- `analysis/code/05_retrospective_no_delay_run_model.R`: script to run the models for the trials testing retrospective memory, without delays
- `analysis/code/06_retrospective_delay_load_data.R`: script to load the data for the trials testing retrospective memory, with delays
- `analysis/code/07_retrospective_delay_run_model.R`: script to run the models for the trials testing retrospective memory, with delays
- `analysis/code/08_enactment_effect_load_data.R`: script to load the data for trials testing the enactment effect
- `analysis/code/09_enactment_effect_run_model.R`: script to run the model for trials testing the enactment effect
- `analysis/code/10_plot_figure_1.R`: script to plot figure 1 from the main text
- `analysis/code/11_plot_figure_2.R`: script to plot figure 2 from the main text
- `analysis/code/12_plot_figure_3.R`: script to plot figure 3 from the main text

NOTE: each code file contains a short description.
